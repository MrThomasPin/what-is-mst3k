       "'You know the story of \"Sweeney Todd\" now, most likely thanks to Tim Burton\\'s recent movie. You probably don\\'t know it though, from this take on the old tale from Andy Milligan-that notorious sleaze merchant that gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money.<br /><br />It had to happen eventually. In my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60\\'s to the 80\\'s, I\\'m finally reviewing an Andy Milligan movie. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie-none of which was any good, and barely watchable. \"The Bloodthirsty Butchers\" is no exception.<br /><br />There is dialog and well, there is talk, and that\\'s one of the things you will find here-lots and lots of talk. The movie reaches almost \"Manos The Hands of Fate\" levels at times, as you wait tirelessly for something to happen. While I love cheap looking gore effects, the violence is too few and far between, and in spite of it\\'s reputation, the \"breast\" scene isn\\'t that shocking. <br /><br />I love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee, but \"Bloodthirsty Butchers\" is the kind of bad that MST3K would tear apart mercilessly. Sadly, Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991, and if there is any movie of his I\\'d say I sort of like, it would be the delirious \"The Ghastly Ones.\" This is no \"Ghastly Ones\" though-it\\'s just bad.'"

Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form. But you do not know truly awful film-making until you have seen Darkhunters. And if you haven\\'t, you shouldn\\'t. Don\\'t bother. Not only is this movie amazingly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and splattered in crude, cheap aftereffects. First of all, it\\'s a pretentious mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an Ittenbach or early Waters sort of fashion. It\\'s the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they\\'ve come up with something incredibly smart. Sort of like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), only that man seems like a freakin\\' messiah when compared to this trainwreck (and this coming from a rampant Shaymalan hater). It\\'s also boring. Not heavy going-type boring, which is okay, if the movie awards your patience. Darkhunters does no such thing. It\\'s boring in a \"Oh my fu(king God, if I see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue I am going to fu(king kill myself!\"-kind of way.<br /><br />Btw. anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.'"

Not too screamy not to masculine but just right. The camera really likes her in this movie. I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.<br /><br />Anyways, this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given. Please watch the uncut version if you see the MST3K.

In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.<br /><br />I've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so. In it's original cut, most reasonable people I think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is average to me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi pic.<br /><br />In contrast to the above, I've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature, dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where I stand, are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based MOSTLY on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on MST3K.

       "'Robot Holocaust is about the lamest, most pathetic attempt at making a post-apocalyptic movie that I\\'ve seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of wretched Mad Max wannabes. Some of those movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo. The plot is nonsensical Â? even with a narrator setting up every scene. And boy does it drag. Scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening. The special effects (and I use the word \"special\" loosely) consist of sock puppets. Yes, that\\'s right Â? sock puppets! The acting is abysmal. Angelika Jager is in the running for worst performance I\\'ve ever seen. Sure, she\\'s French or German or whatever Â? but man is she bad. I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie. So I\\'ll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many.<br /><br />However, and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For a season one episode, the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time. On my MST3K rating scale, I give this episode a 4/5 Â? seek it out.'"

       "'To call \"Rocketship X-M\" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for \"Destination Moon\", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Sea Hunt\\'s Mike Nelson, Rockford\\'s dad and Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for MST3K and is best viewed with commentary from Joel and the robots. This is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the MST3K characters; something preachy, slow-paced, poorly scripted, and full of painfully bad acting. While unintentionally funny stuff like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" don\\'t lend themselves to satirical commentary (because the movie constantly upstages the hosts), really bad and dull movies like \"Rocketship X-M\" are ideal. So add some stars to the rating if you are watching the MST3K version.<br /><br />The basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on Mars. What they find on that planet are the remnants of a human-like civilization devastated by an atomic war. Only one Martian is shown in close-up, a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. The men look like the \"goons\" in the old Popeye cartoons, they scamper agilely around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy-especially if they are supposed to be blind. Of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay.<br /><br />The scenes on Mars are presented in something called \"Sepia Color\" to distinguish them from the rest of the B&W movie. If this has you thinking \"Wizard of Oz\" you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in post-production.<br /><br />In keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie, the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations-both coming and going. Her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and Mike Nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom (insert sound of gagging here).<br /><br />The real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes. The intrepid squad of \"newsies\" are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie, then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. Later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movie\\'s already too obvious message.<br /><br />The DVD has an extremely low audio level, is not captioned, and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you will be thankful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" has several times more content than this entire movie.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I\\'m only a child.'"
